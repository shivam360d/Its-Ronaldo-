# Its-Ronaldo-
Data Analysis on stats of Cristiano Ronaldo available on Kaggle.
In each file, different insights about the game behaviour of Cristiano Ronaldo is extracted out.
Language Used: Python
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/kerneler/starter-cristiano7-43250438-1. Following are the main points covered by each file having the code. There is no as such special reason to do this, but i like Cristiano Ronaldo as an idol. So I think that is why, I attempted to do the same. 

# Find Best Season:
>>In this file, I tried to figure out what is the best season out of all the season given in the data.
>>The same is represented using a bar graph showing number of goals scored in each season.

# Shots Per Season:
>>Don't go by the name. Its not telling us number of shots attempted. But turns out, we can analyse and compare the goals and shot behaviour per season.
>>We can see this by looking at the third plot.
>>In that plot the x axis is the seasons as usual and the y axis is the ratio of goals to shots. That is,it is the ratio of success rate of shot attempts resulting into goals. 
>>We can easily interpret that the plot curve moving upwards signifies greater gaol conversoin rate.

# Remaining Time Vs. Shot Distance
>>Its the most intuitive part of my analysis.
>>Shot distance is the distance measured from the goal to the player's position where it takes the shot.
>>Its quite palpable that with hardly 10 minutes remaining and to do a comeback in the game, any player might fancy its chances to strike a goal from a larger distance relatively.
>>This behaviour is recorded via a line plot.
>>In the plot we can see a general trend that as the remaining number of minutes decreases, the distance of shot increases.
>>Do check the code for better insight.
