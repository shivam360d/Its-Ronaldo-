# Find Best Season:
>>In this file, I tried to figure out what is the best season out of all the season given in the data.
>>The same is represented using a bar graph showing number of goals scored in each season.

# Shots Per Season:
>>Don't go by the name. Its not telling us number of shots attempted. But turns out, we can analyse and compare the goals and shot behaviour per season.
>>We can see this by looking at the third plot.
>>In that plot the x axis is the seasons as usual and the y axis is the ratio of goals to shots. That is,it is the ratio of success rate of shot attempts resulting into goals. 
>>We can easily interpret that the plot curve moving upwards signifies greater gaol conversoin rate.
